<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Ventilation Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilation Machine</li><li>BiPAP Ventilation Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive ventilation machine market primarily includes two types: CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machines and BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines. CPAP machines deliver a constant airflow to keep the airway open, primarily used for obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, BiPAP machines offer two levels of pressure: a higher pressure during inhalation and a lower pressure during exhalation, making it suitable for patients with respiratory conditions such as COPD. Both devices enhance patient comfort and ensure effective ventilation without invasive procedures.</p></p>
